+ Added Alt+Tab, Alt+Backtick, Alt+Ctrl+Tab hotkeys in the settings dialog.
+ Added option to show/hide process info tooltip in the settings dialog.
- Removed the functionality to close the AltTab window when the application goes
  inactive. This was causing the AltTab window to close frequently when the user
  is trying to switch between the windows.
